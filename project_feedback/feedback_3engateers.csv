REINFORCEMENT: I like that...,I like that there had been a lot of discussion about what they wanted. Everyone showed a deep understanding of the application they were working with. I also liked how in depth they had gone into their features.,IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...,Some of the slides seemed really blank. I feel like they could have done more to fill the space of their slides,UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...,I am not unsure about anything. I feel like they did a really great job at explaining what they wanted to look at.,ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...,I feel like it would have been nice to see some features focused on changing the way the tasks were added instead of just focusing on the rpg elements.
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...,The natural charisma of the presenters.,IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...,It would be cool if everyone had the same level of detail for their features.,UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...,How does Habitica work under the hood?,ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...,Have you considered other features instead of the ones you selected?
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...,The presentation was neatly made and displayed. The project seems like a cool piece of software to use and the additions you planned on adding seemed very doable and would make the app better.,IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...,"The software was played for the demo. I have never played this game so I wish we could have saw some of the gameplay in action for the demo, or even some of the code with an explanation.",UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...,"What the game consists of. For example, one of your features was adding pet battles but I wasn't sure how much of an addition this was. You said there are pets in the game but I don't know what the game exactly is so I don't know the significance.",ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...,"Actually implementing some of the features? Even though some of your additions looked like a big project that would take a lot of work, it might be beneficial to actually implement at least a little bit of some features."
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...,I like the open-source project choice. Habitica is interesting. ,IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...,I wish that we would have shown some of the source code and given a small demo of how the task management RPG works. ,UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...,Could have explained the grant chart a bit more instead of skipping over it.,ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...,Have you considered implementing these features into the actual project?
REINFORCEMENT: I like that...,I appreciate the real-life application that the 3Engateers is using for this project. Their project plan and future work leaves hundreds of options to create a structured project plan. I'm excited to see the route that they will take.,IMPROVEMENT: I wish that...  It would be cool if...,"I understand that it is not a requirement to code or add additional features to this project, though from their presentation they have a good list of potential features. It would be awesome to see one, or even a few of these ideas, come to life. ",UNCLEAR: I'm unsure about... Could you explain more about...,"The presentation was pretty straight forward, no questions on my end.",ALTERNATIVES: Have you considered...,One of the many ways that applications like this continue to build their user base is by developing a ranking system (based on currency acquired). Have you considered adding a friends list plus a ranking option so people in each community can see how they match against others?
